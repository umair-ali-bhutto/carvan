        <h2>honda accord overview</h2>
        <p>
            Honda Accord is a mid-size sedan which was launched in 1976. The sedan version of Accord has been a long-standing best selling vehicle in many regions across the globe. The biggest competition comes from Toyota Camry. The Accord name has been used on many different body styles. These include coupes, wagons, crossovers and hatchbacks. In the United States, Accord has enjoyed a lot of success and it became one of the first few Japanese cars to get assembled in the country. This is because the Accord provides ample amount of legroom and headroom for rear passengers. The boot space is sizable and the drive is comfortable in urban areas.
First Generation
 
The first generation was launched in 1976 as a hatchback. It remained in production till 1981. At a later date, a sedan version was introduced. During the first generation, Accord was classified as a compact sedan/hatchback. Two different engine options were provided and these included 1.6L and 1.8L. These engines were paired with either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. Standard equipment included AM/FM radio, cloth seats, intermittent wipers and tachometer. 
 
Second Generation 
Second generation was launched in 1981 and remained in production till 1985. It was still available in both hatchback and sedan body configurations. Five different engine choices were given with three different transmission options. Both automatic and manual transmissions were available for this generation. Notable features included sunroof, leather seats (upper trim levels only), power windows and power locks. Headlamp washers were also included in some regions. 
 
Third Generation 
The third generation was launched in 1985 and continued till 1989. Four body styles were available in this generation: sedan, coupe, hatchback and shooting break. Eight powertrains were available but they were very similar. These engines were either paired with a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. The shooting-break variant was the highlight of this generation. This variant was named AeroDeck. 
 
Fourth Generation 
The fourth generation was in production from 1989 to 1993. The shooting-break model was discontinued and only three body styles were available. These included sedan, coupe and station wagon. Notable features included power steering, power windows, power locks, CD player, center armrest, fog lights and a security system. 
 
Fifth Generation 
The fifth generation was in production from 1993 to 1997. Acura brand was launched under the umbrella of Honda and it started selling premium versions of Accord. Engine and transmission options were similar to those of the third generation. However, the sales Accord were never eroded by Acura models. Honda products have always been cheaper than Acura products. 
 
Sixth to Tenth Generation 
From sixth to the tenth generation, Accord has grown in size. This can be seen in the increased length and width of the car. Seventh generation was very popular in Pakistan and the rest of the world. This was the time when Accord rose to prominence. Accord models have been rated high on safety ratings across the globe. Eighth generations introduced a lot of new features. These included airbags, rear view camera and alloy rims. 
 
The current and the tenth generation is a high tech machine. It includes features like heads-up display (6-inch), lumbar support, PVB laminated windows, power seats and Honda Sensing package for different driver aids. Coupe variant has been discontinued and only the sedan is available for sale. 
 
Honda Accord Pakistan 
Honda Accord Pakistan has been a popular vehicle in Pakistan. However, over the past few years, its numbers have diminished. This is due to the entry of competitors in the market and the fact that Accord is not produced locally. Therefore, it is very expensive to buy and then maintain.
